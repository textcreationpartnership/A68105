            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Elias was a man ≈øubject to like pa≈øsions as wee are, and
hee prayed earne≈øtly that it might not raine, and it
rained not on the earth by the ≈øpace of three yeares

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16509:4"/>
and goodne≈ø≈øe in them, and they are <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
1. For the fir≈øt, <hi>Mat. 15. 28. O woman great is
thy faith, bee it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> What a
large unlimitted Grant and Patent was this for a
poore ≈øinner to aske what ≈øhe would, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe

all things are po≈øsible.</hi> Looke what a beleever
cannot doe him≈øelfe, God him≈øelfe will doe it for
him, and yet it ≈øhal be accounted as his act and deed.
<hi>Phil. 4. 13. I can doe all things through Chri≈øt that
≈øtrengtheneth me:</hi> Not meaning that hee could doe
all things in generall and at large, as to walke on the
waters, flye in the ayre, &amp;c. but all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to his calling, all things that concerned his
Mini≈øtery, and all things that pertained to the right
way of plea≈øing God and of ≈øaving his owne ≈øoule:
He could pray well, Preach well, live well; he could
want and he could abound, he could conforme and
apply him≈øelfe to all e≈øtates what≈øoever: All this
hee could doe, not by any power or ability of his
owne, but by the ≈øtrengthning grace, and faith, and
vertue of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>(I can doe all things through
Chri≈øt that ≈øtrengthneth me.)</hi> As on the contrary, our
Saviour ≈øaith of him≈øelfe, <hi>Mark. 6. 5.</hi> that he could
doe nothing worth ≈øpeaking of in his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

wonder (in re≈øpect of what he could have done) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>becau≈øe of their unbeleife:</hi> and marke, that it is not
≈øaid, <hi>He would</hi> do no ≈øuch workes there, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>He could</hi> not doe them: not that Chri≈øt was unable
for want of power, but hee ≈øaw it was unavaileable
through their lacke of faith. For the power of God,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16509:4"/>
and the faith of men, are like the ≈øpirits and the ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
in the body, the one mooves, and ≈øtirres, and
workes within the other; if there be no faith in us,
there can be no expectation of any power or any
helpe from God.</p>
            <p>2. The other omnipotent grace is <hi>Prayer;</hi> and that
you may be a≈ø≈øured it is ≈øo, marke but that expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Exod. 32. 10. Let me alone</hi> (≈øaith God to <hi>Mo≈øes)
that I may con≈øume them, and I will make of thee a great
Nation.</hi> What a word was this to come from the
mouth of Almighty God, to bid a poore weake
creature, <hi>let him alone:</hi> it ≈øhewes that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> by his
prayer did even (as it were) <hi>over-power</hi> the Lord,
that the Lord had not the power to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe
on that provoking people, as long as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded
for them.</p>
            <p>Such a powerfull man with God was <hi>Eliah</hi> here
in my text: His mouth (as a Father ≈øaith) was <hi>Frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Coeli,</hi> the very bridle of Heaven; he could even
rule the heavens with his prayers, as a man rules a
hor≈øe with a bridle: Now lea≈øt you ≈øhould thinke
he did thus prevaile with God, rather by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his per≈øon, than by the vertue of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
The Apo≈øtle tells us for that, he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he
was a man ≈øubject to the ≈øame pa≈øsions that we are,</hi> and
yet his prayer tooke ≈øuch good effect. <hi>(Eliah was a
man ≈øubject, &amp;c.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my text there are two generall points to bee
con≈øidered. 1. The condition and quality of <hi>Eliahs</hi>
per≈øon, <hi>[He was a man ≈øubject to like pa≈øsions as wee
are]</hi> 2. The condition and quality of his prayer;
that like a two-edged ≈øword, it cut both wayes, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16509:5"/>
prevailed in both kindes; both to bring a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to bring a ble≈ø≈øing upon the people. His
fir≈øt prayer like a burning feaver entred into the
bowels of the earth, and ≈øcorcht and dryed up the
Rivers and Lakes, and Springs, and left no moi≈øture
in them; and ≈øo brought a judgement of drought and
dearth upon the land. His ≈øecond prayer went up
into the clouds above, and fetcht an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> a

that moy≈øtned and fatned, and refre≈øhed the earth
againe <hi>[He prayed againe, and the heavens gave raine,
and the earth brought forth her fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The condition and quality of <hi>Eliahs</hi> per≈øon,
what manner of man <hi>Eliah</hi> was? My Text ≈øaith hee
was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>A man ≈øubject to the ≈øame pa≈øsions,</hi> to
the ≈øame frailties and infirmities <hi>that we are.</hi> Hence
you may ob≈øerve, that no profe≈ø≈øion of holine≈ø≈øe,
no practi≈øe of piety, no degree of grace and ≈øanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in this life, can exempt, or free, or priviledge
a man from common pa≈ø≈øions, and infirmities, <hi>Eliah</hi>
was a man of God, a mortified and a ≈øanctified man,
and one of the greate≈øt favourites in the Court of
heaven, and yet a man ≈øubject to pa≈ø≈øions. What
≈øhall I neede to multiply examples to proove this
point, when wee know the Apo≈øtle affirmeth even
of our Saviour him≈øelfe, <hi>That hee was in all things
like unto us ≈øinne onely excepted:</hi> ≈øet but ≈øinne a≈øide
(where of his ble≈ø≈øed per≈øon was uncapable, for as
no ru≈øt can take hold of burning and flaming iron;
no more could any ≈øin or corruption take hold of his
pure and precious ≈øoule) ≈øet but that a≈øide, and our
Saviour Chri≈øt was (as <hi>Eliah</hi> is ≈øaid to be) <gap reason="foreign">

man ≈øubject to the very ≈øame infirmities and pa≈øsions,</hi> of
anger, and feare, and ≈øorrow, and ≈øadne≈ø≈øe, <hi>that wee
are:</hi> and happy was it for us that ≈øo he was; for by
this meanes he became (as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>Heb. 2.
17. A mercifull High-Prie≈øt,)</hi> one that knew how
to tender and ≈øuccour our infirmities, becau≈øe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe
had a feeling of them in his owne nature. This
made him ≈øo tenderly affected towards the hungry
multitude, <hi>Mat. 15.</hi> becau≈øe him≈øelfe knew by his
owne experience what an un≈øufferable mi≈øery hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was. This made him ≈øo compa≈ø≈øionate towards
the ≈øorrowes of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha, Iohn 11.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe

God will winke at; and not rather ≈øinnes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption
and iniquity, ≈øuch as his ≈øoule abhorres?
An≈øwer, A ≈øinne of infirmity may be knowne two
wayes.</p>
            <p>1. By the antecedent which goes before it; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16509:7"/>
that is an hone≈øt re≈øolution of a mans heart again≈øt
≈øinne and evill; when a man doth ≈øtedfa≈øtly re≈øolve
(by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and grace of God) to ≈øeparate
him≈øelfe from every knowne ≈øinne, and to ≈øanctifie
him≈øelfe in all holy duty and obedience to God,
≈øtriving by a holy de≈øire and an hearty endeavour, in
nothing willingly to ≈øinne again≈øt God, but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing to plea≈øe him and approove him≈øelfe unto
him: if ≈øuch a man chance to fall by occa≈øion into
a fault, or be overtaken unawares (as the Apo≈øtle
≈øpeakes, <hi>Gal. 6. 1.)</hi> be≈øides the purpo≈øe of his heart,
and the intention and de≈øire of his ≈øoule: that mans
≈øinnes, are ≈øinnes of infirmity, which by the mercy
of God ≈øhall never be laid to his charge. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when a man ≈øhall hang <hi>in equilibrio,</hi> in an even
ballance (as it were) betwixt wickedne≈ø≈øe and
goodne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øhall be equally di≈øpo≈øed to ≈øinne or
not to ≈øinne as occa≈øion ≈øhall offer it ≈øelfe; or which
is wor≈øe, ≈øhall doe like him, <hi>P≈øal. 36. 4.</hi> ≈øhall ≈øet, and
≈øettle him≈øelfe in a way that is not good, re≈øolving
with him≈øelfe, that this ≈øinne fits my turne, and
plea≈øeth my humour, and I will not part with it: or
which is wor≈øt of all, when a man ≈øhall <hi>draw iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with cords of vanity</hi> (as the Prophet ≈øpeaketh) as
if the devill were backeward, and ≈øinne would not
come fa≈øt enough upon him of its owne accord;
≈øhall fi≈øh and angle for it, and hunt after ill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and draw him≈øelfe and others into ≈øinne, as Fi≈øh
and Fowles are drawne into a net, to their ruine and
de≈øtruction; this mans ≈øinnes are farre beyond the
≈øinne of infirmity, for they are ≈øinnes of iniquity,
and ≈øinnes of ob≈øtinacy, and ≈øuch as will co≈øt him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16509:8"/>
many a ≈øigh, many a groane, many a teare, before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he ≈øhall attaine to this comfortable per≈øwa≈øion,
that there is compa≈ø≈øion with God, and ≈øalvation
with Chri≈øt for his ≈øoule.</p>
            <p>2. A ≈øinne of infirmity is knowne by the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of it, or that which followes after it: it leaves
≈øuch a ≈øting behind it in the ≈øoule, that a man can
never be at quiet in his owne con≈øcience, till he hath
made his peace with God by a ≈øound and ≈øerious
humiliation, and reconciled him≈øelfe againe to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus
Chri≈øt. Yea, it never leaves a man, till it hath
brought him to that ≈øame <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes of, <hi>2 Cor. 7. 11.</hi> that
a man ≈øhall even fret and vexe and fall out with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe
for offending and provoking ≈øo good, ≈øo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a God. It will make a man upbraid him≈øelfe for
a very bea≈øt and a foole (as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>P≈øal. 73.) So
ignorant was I, and ≈øo fooli≈øh, even as a bea≈øt before thee.</hi>
And it is a ≈øure rule, that of Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine; Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
non nocent, ≈øi non placent; if a mans ≈øinnes doe not
plea≈øe him, they will never hurt him.</hi> Whereas on the
contrary, when a man can carry away his ≈øinnes as
lightly as <hi>Samp≈øon</hi> carryed the gates of <hi>Azza,</hi> that
they are no burthen to his ≈øoule; or if they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to trouble him, ≈øhall doe as <hi>Saul</hi> did, betake
him≈øelfe to mu≈øicke and ≈øport, and merry company
to drive it away (as if one ≈øinne could drive out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not rather drive it further in:) beleeve
it, this mans ≈øinnes are no ≈øinnes of infirmity, but
they are ≈øinnes of an higher nature, and ≈øuch as will
co≈øt a man deare ere he can be acquitted of them in
the ≈øight of God. And this I dare confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16509:8"/>
that there is no man that ≈øinnes of infirmity,
but he is afterward the better for his ≈øinne; it makes
him the more jealous of him≈øelfe, the more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
over his wayes, the more carefull to ≈øerve and
plea≈øe God, than ever he had beene in former times.
Whereupon ≈øaith Saint <hi>Au≈øtin,</hi> upon tho≈øe words
of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Rom. 8. Omnia cooperantur, &amp;c. All
things worke together for good to them that love God.
Etiam pecata Domine, Even our very ≈øinnes O Lord;</hi>
for by ≈øinne wee have experience of our infirmity,
our infirmity brings us downe to humility, humility
brings us home to God, and in God every man hath
his <hi>quietus e≈øt,</hi> a happy di≈øcharge from all his ≈øins.
This being done, one thing onely remaines, and
that is this; A man that hath ≈øinned of infirmity,
will labour to bring forth that ≈øame <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> which
<hi>Iohn Bapti≈øt</hi> ≈øpeakes of, <hi>Mat. 3. 8. The worthy fruites
of repentance;</hi> for you mo≈øt know, that repentance
is one thing, and the fruit of repentance is another;
it is not enough to repent, and be ≈øorry for what a
man hath done (≈øo did <hi>Iudas,</hi> ≈øo did <hi>Ahab)</hi> but he
mu≈øt hone≈øtly and unfainedly endeavour to bring
forth the fruit of repentance, and that is the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and alteration of his life, and conver≈øation
in the ≈øight of God and men. If it be thus with thee,
take comfort (in Gods name) from this comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Doctrine, that thou art no other then <hi>Eliah</hi> was,
a man ≈øubject to pa≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>It followes; <hi>Eliah was a man ≈øubject to pa≈øsions,
yet he prayed;</hi> Hence we may learne, never to be ≈øo
dejected at the view of our frailties and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as to forbeare our re≈øorting to God in prayer.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16509:9"/>
For no man living hath ≈øo much neede to pray to
God, as a man ≈øubject to pa≈ø≈øions. It was one part
of <hi>Solomons</hi> reque≈øt to God, <hi>2 Chron. 6. 29. When
any one ≈øhall perceive and feele his owne ≈øore, his owne
griefe,</hi> and the Plague of his owne heart (as he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
a mans owne corruption) what ≈øhall hee doe?
Shall he de≈øpaire, ≈øhall hee be driven backe from
God (as <hi>Iordan</hi> was driven backe at the pre≈øence of
the <hi>Arke)</hi> no, let him doe this; let him downe
upon his knees to God, and ≈øpread forth his hands
to Heaven, and the Lord which dwelleth in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will heare him, and when he heares, have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
It was an amazed and unadvi≈øed prayer, that of
<hi>Simon</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>Luke 5. 8.</hi> when hee cryed
out, <hi>Lord goe from me, for I am a ≈øinfull man;</hi> as if
a Patient ≈øhould ≈øay to the Phy≈øitian, depart from
mee, for I am ≈øicke. The ≈øicker a man is, the more
neede he hath of the Phy≈øitians pre≈øence; and the
≈øinfuller he is, the more neede to draw neere to his
Saviour: as a man that ≈øhivers of an Ague creepes
nearer and nearer to the fire. You know our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
gracious call, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary
and heavy laden, and I will ea≈øe you.</hi> Now (as Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> ≈øaith,) every Chri≈øtian is <hi>Animal oneriferum,
a burden-bearing creature;</hi> not a Chri≈øtian upon earth
but hath ≈øome cro≈ø≈øe or other to clogge him, ≈øome
corruption or other to burthen him at times, and
lies heavy upon his heart; what then is to be done?
Shall hee lye downe like <hi>I≈ø≈øachar,</hi> and couch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his burthen? Shall hee be di≈øheartened and
di≈øcouraged from re≈øorting and approaching to
God? God forbid; let him in Gods name come to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16509:9"/>
Ie≈øus Chri≈øt that cals him, with teares in his eyes,
with true griefe and godly ≈øorrow in his heart, with
humble confe≈ø≈øions and prayers in his mouth; and
he hath promi≈øed <hi>in verbo ≈øervatoris,</hi> in the word
of a Saviour, that he will relea≈øe and ea≈øe him of it.
One thing I mu≈øt tell thee by the way, when thou
praye≈øt to Chri≈øt for ea≈øe, thou mu≈øt promi≈øe him
obedience and ≈øervice; as the I≈øraelites did to <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,
1 Reg. 12. Ea≈øe us of our burthen, and we will
be thy ≈øervants for ever.</hi> Thus doe, and then let thy
burthen be never ≈øo great, thy corruptions never
≈øo many, thy pa≈ø≈øions never ≈øo ≈øtrong; Hee that
could calme the ≈øea, can calme thy ≈øorrowes, and
≈øpeake peace unto thy ≈øoule in the mid≈øt of all thy
troubles, and therefore, if at any time thy pa≈ø≈øions
be ≈øtirred, and thy heart di≈øquieted within thee;
know of a ≈øurety, that, there is ≈øome <hi>Ionah</hi> that
hath rai≈øed this ≈øtorme, ≈øome ≈øinne or other that
hath cau≈øed this trouble to thy ≈øoule; then fall to
thy prayers (as <hi>Eliab</hi> did) and give God no re≈øt, till
God hath given re≈øt to thy ≈øoule. <hi>Eliah was a man
≈øubject to pa≈øsions, and he prayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It followes, How did he pray? My Text ≈øaith, <hi>he

it, <hi>He prayed earne≈øtly,</hi> and it is to very good
purpo≈øe; for it implies thus much: that no prayer
is a prayer indeede, but an earne≈øt prayer. Cold
and carele≈ø≈øe prayers, counterfeit and ≈øuper≈øtitious
prayers, they be but <hi>res nihili,</hi> in Gods account no
prayers at all. I will give you an in≈øtance, <hi>Act. 9.
11.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> was converted and ≈øtricken with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16509:10"/>
blindne≈ø≈øe, Almighty God ≈øent <hi>Ananias</hi> to him

lay his hands upon a wrong party, God gives him
this private token to know him by, <hi>forbehold he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
Now let mee demand; doe you thinke that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> never prayed to God till that time? or
doe you imagine that was the fir≈øt prayer that ever
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> made? It is the fir≈øt wee reade of; but
doe you thinke hee never prayed before? I beleeve
he did many a time and oft; and I will give you my
rea≈øon: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (you know) was a Phari≈øee, one
of the ≈øtricte≈øt and devoute≈øt of all the Sect (as hee
te≈øtifies of him≈øelfe) and the Phari≈øees, you know,
were altogether given to long praying; it was their
glory and their gaine too, that they could make long
prayers in every place, in the open ≈øtreetes, in wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
hou≈øes; and no doubt but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had as
excellent a faculty that way, and could pray as long
and as largely as the be≈øt of them all: but ≈øee the i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øue:
Almighty God, who ≈øtiles him≈øelfe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of prayers, gave no eare, tooke no notice of all
his formall, Phari≈øaicall, hypocriticall prayers,
which he had made in former times; till hee came
to this humble, this earne≈øt, this heart-breaking
prayer; <hi>And now</hi> (≈øaith God) <hi>Behold he prayeth;</hi> he
never prayed indeed, till now: for as <hi>Philo</hi> ≈øaith
well; God doth not <hi>numerare,</hi> but <hi>ponderare, not
number our prayers, but weigh them;</hi> if he finde them
cordiall, if hee finde them hearty, that they have
≈øome ≈øub≈øtance, and ≈øome weight in them, then he
records and regi≈øters and ≈øets them downe in that

winke at them, pa≈ø≈øe by, and take no notice of them;
let no man therefore deceive him≈øelfe to thinke that
all kinde of praying ≈øpeedes alike, for no prayer is a
prayer in Gods account, but an earne≈øt prayer, <hi>Eliah</hi>

            <p>Furthermore, it is worth your noting, to ≈øee the

both of the King, and of the people. Now
here you may ob≈øerve the equability, the evenne≈ø≈øe

≈øo he was as earne≈øt in his devotions; and as

and zealou≈øly affected in one good thing as well as
another, in devotion, as well as reprehen≈øion, in
prayer, as well as in anger. When a mans zeale is
equable (like <hi>Eliahs)</hi> then it is right and plea≈øing to
God.</p>
            <p>As Phy≈øitians judge of the ≈øtate of a mans body,
<hi>Vniver≈øalia ≈øalutaria, particularia ex mo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>bo;</hi> as thus:
if a man be hot in one part and cold in another; if the
palmes of his hands burne, and the ≈øoles of his feete
be key-cold, then all is not right; but if he be of an
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16509:11"/>
indifferent equall heate all over, that held a good
≈øigne of good health in the body. By the like rule
judge thou of the ≈øtate of thy ≈øoule, if thy zeale be
equable and uniforme both in prayer and in anger,
it is a good ≈øigne of grace and ≈øanctification in thy
heart; but if it vary and differ, that there is too
much heate in the one, too little in the other; all is
not well within. It was the rea≈øon which old Father
<hi>Latimer</hi> gave, why men in the≈øe dayes doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
with God in their prayers, as <hi>Eliah</hi> and ≈øuch
others had done in former times, <hi>Dee≈øt ignis</hi> (≈øaith
he) <hi>dee≈øt ignis, There lackes fire, there lackes fire;</hi>
his meaning is, our prayers want that zeale, that
heate, that earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe, which they put into theirs.
For as incen≈øe without fire yeelds no ≈ømell, no more
doth prayer without zeale and earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe; and as
Hony is no Hony, if it have lo≈øt its ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe; and
Vinegar is no Vinegar, if it have lo≈øt its ≈øharpene≈ø≈øe;
≈øo Prayer is no Prayer, if it bee voide of earne≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.
<hi>Eliah</hi> prayed indeede, becau≈øe hee prayed
earne≈øtly.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the ≈øubject, and matter of his
Prayer which (I told you) was fir≈øt for a judgement,
and then for a ble≈ø≈øing, fir≈øt for a drought, and then
for raine, as it followeth. <hi>Hee prayed earne≈øtly that it
might not raine, and it rained not on the earth by the
≈øpace of three yeares and ≈øixe moneths.</hi> Here are two
weighty points to be con≈øidered. 1. What ≈øhould
moove <hi>Eliah</hi> to pray for a judgement. 2. Why he
made choi≈øe to pray for this kinde of judgement, of
drought and dearth, rather then for any other. I will
tell you my opinion of both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:16509:11"/>
1. Vpon what ground, or by what warrant did
<hi>Eliah</hi> pray for a judgement. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit)
≈øeemes to taxe him for it, <hi>Rom. 11. 2.</hi> and he
brings it in with a <hi>notandum, wote ye not (i.)</hi> doe ye
not marke and ob≈øerve what the Scripture ≈øaith of
<hi>Eliah, how he made interce≈øsion to God again≈øt I≈ørael.</hi>
Good men in former times were wont to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce≈ø≈øion
to God <hi>For</hi> the people, not <hi>Again≈øt</hi> them:
<hi>Abraham</hi> prayed for the wicked <hi>Sodomites, Ieremy</hi>
prayed for the Idolatrous <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> till God forbad
him, and gave him a countermand, <hi>Pray no more for
this people, for I will not heare thee, Ier. 11. 14.</hi> The
Husbandman in the Parable entreates his Ma≈øter for
the unfruitfull tree, that he would ≈øpare it and not
cut it downe, and doth <hi>Eliah</hi> differ from all the re≈øt,
and bend his prayers again≈øt the people, and pray
for the vexation and undoing of his Country? How
could this ≈øtand with that good Religion, and that
good affection which ≈øo holy a man ≈øhould beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the people of God? An≈øwer. Three things
there are (in my weake judgement) that may ≈øeeme
to warrant and beare out <hi>Eliah</hi> in praying for a
judgement.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Authoritas Prophetica,</hi> Prophets might doe
more then ordinary per≈øons, and <hi>Eliah</hi> had the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Prophe≈øie, and knew by revelation from God,
that ≈øuch a judgement was a comming, therefore
he might the more warrantably and unoffen≈øively
frame his de≈øires to Gods appointments, and fit his
prayers to Gods purpo≈øes. Thus mu≈øt we conceive
of tho≈øe bitter execrations and imprecations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>David</hi> did ≈øo often in the P≈øalmes cur≈øe and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16509:12"/>
banne his enemies, <hi>[Let their Table be their ≈ønare,
let their children be vagabondes and begge their bread,
&amp;c.]</hi> A man would thinke it could not ≈øtand with
the piety and charity of a godly man, to wi≈øh ≈øuch
wicked events, ≈øuch uncharitable wi≈øhes to proceed
out of his mouth: but onely that we know, he was
a Prophet of God, and did it <hi>per afflatum divinum,
by the direction and in≈øpiration of the Holy Gho≈øt;</hi> he
knew by the ≈øpirit of Prophe≈øie, they were ≈øuch as
were accur≈øed of God, being Gods enemies as well
as his, and therefore might the more warrantably
and ≈øafely doe it. It is not for us to u≈øe <hi>Davids</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes,
unle≈ø≈øe we had <hi>Davids</hi> ≈øpirit. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi>
had that gift which the Apo≈øtle cals <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>the di≈øcerning ≈øpirits;</hi> they knew by in≈øtinct from
heaven, who were ble≈ø≈øed and who were cur≈øed of
God. It is not ≈øo with us, God hath hid tho≈øe ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
from our eyes, and therefore it is our part and
duty to pray in love and charity, <hi>That God would
have mercy upon all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what u≈øe then are we to make of tho≈øe cur≈øes
in the P≈øalmes that are read ≈øo often to us? An≈øwer,
Thus we may doe, we may apply them to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Church, that ≈øeeke the ruine of the true
Religion, and profe≈ø≈øe an open enmity to the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and faith of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt (Who is God ble≈ø≈øed for
ever) we may ≈øafely take our Saviours part, and cur≈øe
all tho≈øe that are enemies to him: <hi>[So let all thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
peri≈øh, O Lord, Iud. 5. 31.]</hi> But for our owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
that have done us ≈øome private wrong, or
bare us ≈øome ≈øecret grudge, to cur≈øe them and ban
them in this kinde (as the u≈øuall manner of ≈øome is)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16509:12"/>
it is both unwarrantable, uncharitable, and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But the be≈øt and ≈øafe≈øt u≈øe, that we can make of
tho≈øe cur≈øes, is to appropriate and apply them to
our ≈øelves, to acknowledge and adjudge our ≈øelves
worthy to undergoe all tho≈øe deadly evils, and that
God may ju≈øtly doe ≈øo; and more than ≈øo unto us,
if hee ≈øhould deale with us according to our ≈øinnes;
by this meanes we ≈øhall ≈øave God a labour, and our
≈øelves a paine. For as on the contrary, to ble≈ø≈øe our
≈øelves is the way to make God cur≈øe us, <hi>Deut. 29.
20. Hee that ble≈ø≈øeth him≈øelfe when hee heareth the
words of the≈øe cur≈øes, ≈øaying, I ≈øhall have peace though
I walke in the imagination of my owne heart, adding
drunkenne≈ø≈øe to thir≈øt.</hi> (marke what followes) <hi>The
Lord will be revenged upon the ≈øoule of ≈øuch a one, his
anger and his jealou≈øie ≈øhall ≈ømoke again≈øt that man, and
all the cur≈øes that are written in this booke ≈øhall light
upon him, and the Lord ≈øhall blot out his name from
under Heaven.</hi> This a man gets by ble≈ø≈øing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe:
whereas if thou would≈øt be ble≈øt of God, I
doe not ≈øay, that thou ≈øhould≈øt cur≈øe thy ≈øelfe (farre
be it from any ≈øervant of Chri≈øt ≈øo to doe) but this
I would advi≈øe thee to doe, even with a ≈øorrowfull
and a ≈øad heart, to ≈øay <hi>Amen</hi> to all the cur≈øes in the
Booke of God, to acknowledge and confe≈ø≈øe that
thou ha≈øt ju≈øtly de≈øerved, and that it is Gods onely
mercy that thou ha≈øt e≈øcaped them. So much for
the fir≈øt rea≈øon that may warrant <hi>Eliahs</hi> prayer; the
next may be this.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Convenientia temporis,</hi> the fitne≈ø≈øe and order
of time when this was done, it was done in the time
of the Law, which was u≈øed to ≈øuch judgements,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16509:13"/>
they were then accu≈øtomed to more terrible won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
than are now ≈øutable to the ≈øweete and ≈øaving
time of the Go≈øpel; ob≈øerve the wonders that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi>
wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> what terrible, what hurtfull,
what mi≈øchievous wonders they were, he turned all
their water into blood, all their du≈øt into Lice, and
≈øpoyled all the fruits of the earth, and undid the
whole Land. What a dreadfull wonder was that
of <hi>Eli≈øha, 2 Reg. 2.</hi> when he cur≈øed the children of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi>
that mocked him for his baldne≈ø≈øe: One would
have thought that a little di≈øcipline, a little correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or ≈øending to their Parents or Ma≈øters, would
have ≈øufficed, and beene a ≈øufficient revenge for
waggi≈øh unhappy boyes, that did not know their
duty to a man of God: but hee lookes upon them
with a direfull countenance, and <hi>cur≈øed</hi> and banned
<hi>them in the name of the Lord,</hi> and immediately <hi>two
Shee-beares came out of the Wood, and tare two and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them in pieces:</hi> what a horrible, what a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
what a mi≈øcheivous wonder was this? Of the
≈øame kind was that of <hi>Eliah, 2 Reg. 1.</hi> When the
Captaine came with authority, to bid him come
downe, and come before the King; he might have
an≈øwered, I cannot come, or the Lord appointed
me ≈øome other way to goe, &amp;c. but the next word
we heare, is a word of Iudgement and Vengeance,
<hi>If I be a man of God, let fire come downe from heaven,
and con≈øume thee, and thy company:</hi> and ≈øo it did both
them, and the re≈øt that came after on the ≈øame me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage.
Such wonders as the≈øe were u≈øuall in the time
of the Law. But now looke to the Miracles and
Wonders of our Saviour in the Go≈øpell, and you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16509:13"/>
≈øhall finde them to be of another nature, all of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe
and mercy, all mercifull, all beneficiall, all
healing Miracles, no way hurtfull or de≈øtructive of
any mans life. We read of many a mans life that he
≈øaved, many that hee recalled and re≈øtored, none
that he de≈øtroyed, no not one: being ≈øo reviled as
he was, ≈øo per≈øecuted, ≈øo laid for, ≈øo betrayed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
condemned and crucified; yet what
one man did our Saviour ≈øtrike dead for all the≈øe
haynous indignities? Nay, he was ≈øo farre from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
that he prayed for their lives that ≈øought and
wrought his death.</p>
            <p>The mo≈øt terrible wonders that ever our Saviour
did, were but two, and tho≈øe no wayes prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the per≈øon or life of any man, woman, or
childe. The one was his <hi>cur≈øing</hi> and bla≈øting of <hi>the
barren Figge-tree;</hi> and this was but ≈øymbolicall,
not done in any ≈øpleene to the poore tree; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ≈øhew his indignation again≈øt all unfruitfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion;
when men make an outward ≈øhew of piety
to God; but when the poore and hungry come to
them (as Chri≈øt came to that Figge-tree) hoping
to pull ≈øome fruite of charity and mercy from them,
there is nothing to be found but leaves, good words
perhaps, and that is all: beleeve it, ≈øuch men are
nigh unto cur≈øing, and it is Gods infinite mercy, if
he doe not bla≈øt their e≈øtate (as Chri≈øt did the Fig-tree)
that it ≈øhall never pro≈øper to them nor theirs.
The other wonder of Chri≈øt that did any hurt, was
that, <hi>Matth. 8. The drowning of the Swine,</hi> and yet
that was the devils doing, Chri≈øt onely gave way
to the≈øe evill ≈øpirits (which ≈øeeke the de≈øtruction of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16509:14"/>
man and bea≈øt) to carry them headlong into the ≈øea
(as they would carry us too, but that God above,
who ≈øtiles him≈øelfe <hi>The pre≈øerver of men,</hi> is plea≈øed
in mercy to keepe out of their clutches;) and this
was ≈øymbolicall too, to let us under≈øtand how God
hates all tho≈øe that are of a <hi>≈øwini≈øh di≈øpo≈øition;</hi> that
is, all drunken ≈øots, that like ≈øwine, have neither
wit nor grace to moderate them≈øelves in the u≈øe of
Gods creatures; and all lazy bea≈øts that minde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their bellies, (as you know) a Swine is
one of the lazie≈øt creatures that a man can keepe, it
doth him no worke, nor ≈øervice at all; or la≈øtly,
All hoggi≈øh worldlings, and mi≈øerable mucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes
of the earth, that never doe good till they
come to dye: let all ≈øuch tremble and feare, and
call to God for mercy, lea≈øt in his ju≈øt judgement he
deliver their ≈øoules into the hands of tho≈øe helli≈øh
Fiends to carry them headlong (as they did the
Swine) <hi>into the lake that burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone
for evermore, there ≈øhall be weeping and gna≈øhing
of teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe are the two ≈øevere≈øt wonders that ever our
Saviour did, or ≈øuffered to be done; as for all the
re≈øt (looke into the Stories of the Go≈øpell, which
are the Acts and Monuments of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt) you
≈øhall finde to be all gracious, all beneficiall, all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and ≈øaving wonders. Never any man came to
him for ≈øight, that went away blind; never any
came to him for hearing, that went away deafe;
never any came to him for health, that went away
≈øicke. In a word, you ≈øhall never finde that ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man or woman came to our Saviour for any helpe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16509:14"/>
or mercy, that ever went away confounded or di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
of their hopes. Now beloved, Chri≈øt is
the ≈øame Ie≈øus ≈øtill, that then hee was: <hi>Coelum non
animum</hi> (as wee ≈øay) though hee have changed his
place, he hath not changed his nature, but is ≈øtill as
favourable, as indulgent to mankind as ever he was,
if we doe but as truely ≈øeeke unto him for our ≈øoules
health, as they did for their bodies.</p>
            <p>So you ≈øee the nature of the≈øe wonders is altered
from that they were in <hi>Eliahs</hi> times: the ≈øeverity
of the Law ≈øuites not with the lenity of the Go≈øpell;
and wee mu≈øt now imitate our Saviour in workes of
mercy, and not follow <hi>Eliah</hi> in prayers for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Wee ≈øee, <hi>Luke 9. 54.</hi> When the Di≈øciples
fingers itched to be revenged on the <hi>Samaritans</hi> for
their ba≈øe di≈øcourte≈øie in not entertaining our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
<hi>Ma≈øter,</hi> (≈øaith they) <hi>wilt thou that we command
fire from Heaven, and con≈øume them, as Eliah did?</hi>
Wee have a pre≈øident for it, it is a booke ca≈øe, <hi>Eliah</hi>
did ≈øo, let us doe the like, the≈øe men de≈øerve it, as
bad or wor≈øe than they with whom <hi>Eliah</hi> had to
doe: <hi>No,</hi> (≈øaith our Saviour, the ca≈øe is altered) <hi>ye
know not of what ≈øpirit ye are;</hi> the ≈øpirit of the Law
required ≈øeverity, the ≈øpirit of the Go≈øpell requires
meekene≈ø≈øe and mercy. Farre is it from the good
Spirit of Chri≈øt and of God, to ≈øtirre up any mans
heart to private revenge; not an Eagle, but a Dove
was the ≈øhape wherein that holy and healthfull Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
made choi≈øe to appeare. Let us therefore all that
are called Chri≈øtians, follow no other pre≈øident, but
our Saviour Chri≈øts; who≈øe onely le≈ø≈øon that ever
he ≈øet us to learne of him, was this, to be humble and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16509:15"/>
meeke, and ≈øo doing we ≈øhall find <hi>Requiem animabus;
re≈øt and peace to our owne ≈øoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third and la≈øt rea≈øon that may warrant <hi>Eliah</hi>
in praying for a judgement, was,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Nece≈øsitas rei, the nece≈øsity of the thing it ≈øelfe;</hi>
that holy Prophet had ≈øpent his ≈øtrength in vaine,
Sermon upon Sermon, warning upon warning,
threatning upon threatning; and when he ≈øaw that
nothing would worke them to goodne≈ø≈øe, then he
prayes for a judgement; not in a vindictive way to
be revenged upon them, but as a de≈øperate remedy,
knowing that that or nothing would bring them to
good, as it is ≈øaid, <hi>2 Chron. ult.</hi> God ≈øent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>ri≈øing early and ≈øending them,</hi> and u≈øed all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
meanes to reclaime them, <hi>till there was no remedy,</hi>
then he ≈øent de≈øtruction. In this ≈øence, if a man have
a child or a friend, or any one that he wi≈øheth well
to his ≈øoule; if he be growne to that pa≈ø≈øe, ≈øo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ≈øinne, that no per≈øwa≈øions, no warnings, no
threatnings will worke upon him; I am per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it were neither uncharitable, nor unplea≈øing to
God, if a man ≈øhould pray, Lord ≈ømite him, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
him, lay ≈øome medicinall, ≈øome healing pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment
upon him, that hee may ≈øee the errour
of his wayes, and may returne and repent, and ≈øo be
≈øaved.</p>
            <p>Vpon the≈øe and the like grounds, I ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>Eliah</hi>
might with a ≈øafe con≈øcience pray for a judgement:
but then the next que≈øtionis, Why he ≈øhould make
choi≈øe to pray for this kind of judgment, of drought
and dearth, for want of raine; rather then any other.
I will tell you what I thinke the rea≈øons may be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:16509:15"/>
1. Becau≈øe it was an uncontrouleable, a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
judgement; if <hi>Eliah</hi> ≈øhould have brought any
earthly or vi≈øible judgement, as Sword or Pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
&amp;c. they would have imputed it pre≈øently to
≈øome ≈øecondary meanes and cau≈øes; now this was
a heavenly an invi≈øible judgement, the ≈øtoppage of
the clouds, the detaining of Raine, and the burning
and ≈øcorching of the Sunne; was a judgement from
heaven, and ≈øuch as they mu≈øt needes confe≈ø≈øe to be
<hi>Digitus, the finger of God,</hi> not <hi>Aliquid humani,</hi> no
handy worke of any mortall man. For this was the
fallacy which the Scribes and Phari≈øees put upon
our Saviour <hi>Math. 16. 1.</hi> When they had ≈øeene all
the miracles and wonders of Chri≈øt, how he cured
the ≈øicke, &amp;c. they conceited that the≈øe things
might be done by ≈ølight of hand, by Art of Magicke,
by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> or by Conjuration, &amp;c. but (≈øay they)
<hi>Shew us a ≈øigne from heaven; and then we will beleeve.</hi>
They knew that a Magician or a devill might doe
much upon earth, but he could doe nothing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
therefore (≈øay they) <hi>≈øhew us a ≈øigne from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and we will beleeve.</hi> So here to prevent all mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceites,
<hi>Elias</hi> prayed and procures a judgement
from heaven; and that a convincing a cutting judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for you mu≈øt know that the people at that
time left off to wor≈øhip the true God, and fell to
wor≈øhip <hi>Baall,</hi> the Sunne, the Moone, and all the
Hoa≈øt of Heaven; tru≈øting no doubt that the≈øe gods
of theirs, would by their influence ≈øo moy≈øten and
fatten the earth, that they ≈øhould not need to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to God for any raine: now (quoth <hi>Eliah)</hi>
here is a judgement to try yours gods withall, goe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16509:16"/>
to the gods that ye have ≈øerved, let them helpe now
or never, if they can doe any thing, they can ≈øend a
≈øhowre of rayne, if not, why doe ye ≈øerve them?
I ≈øay it was a convincing judgement. <hi>Eliah</hi> did it on
purpo≈øe, to let them ≈øee the vilene≈ø≈øe of their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
what ba≈øe, what impotent, what unworthy
gods they ≈øerved, that could not helpe their clyents
to a droppe of raine. In like manner, what≈øoever a
man makes his god, be≈øides the true one; I meane,
puts his tru≈øt in, for helpe in time of neede; ≈øhall
at length ≈øo deceive him, and ≈øo befoole him, that
hee ≈øhall bee forced to confe≈ø≈øe, as the≈øe people
did in the end; <hi>The Lord he is God, The Lord hee is
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Becau≈øe it was a ju≈øt and a fitting puni≈øhment;
this people were guilty of ≈øpirituall barrenne≈ø≈øe, and
God plagued them with temporall barrenne≈ø≈øe. No
Nation under heaven was ≈øo husbanded, and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of God, ≈øo watered with the dewes of heaven,
I meane, with the meanes of grace and ≈øalvation, as
they were, and yet none more unfruitfull in every
good worke: Now therefore <hi>Eliah</hi> fits them with
a judgement ≈øutable and agreeable to their ≈øinne: he
prayes to God that it might not raine, that ≈øo their
lands might be an≈øwerable to their lives, and their
foyles become as barren as their ≈øoules. Thus it
plea≈øeth God many times to pay men in their owne
coyne, to come home to them in their owne kinde,
and to fit his puni≈øhments according to their ≈øinnes.
That as they that ≈øinne in their goods, by mi≈øget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
miskeeping, and mi≈øpending them, are many
times puni≈øhed in their goods, by lo≈ø≈øes, and cro≈ø≈øes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16509:16"/>
by fire, by water, &amp;c. And as they that ≈øinne in their
children, by mi≈øloving, or mi≈ønurturing them, are
oft times puni≈øhed in their children, as <hi>David</hi> was
in <hi>Ab≈øolom</hi> and <hi>Adonijah;</hi> ≈øo they that ≈øinne in
their lands: it is ju≈øt with God to puni≈øh them in
their lands: <hi>Solomon</hi> tels us, <hi>Prov. 21. 4.</hi> that <hi>the
plowing of a wicked man is ≈øinne,</hi> That is ≈øtrange; the
husbandry and tillage of the ground is generally
held to be one of the mo≈øt hone≈øt, the mo≈øt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
the mo≈øt harmele≈ø≈øe callings in the world; and
≈øo it is of it ≈øelfe; and yet wee ≈øee, when a wicked
man takes the plow in hand; when a man goes to his
plow with an ill minde, and an ill con≈øcience, his
very plowing addes to his ≈øinnes. And it is ju≈øt with
God, that that land which is plowed ≈øinfully, ≈øhould
thrive accordingly, and become as bad and as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
as the owner. <hi>A fruitfull land doth God make
barren, for the wickedne≈ø≈øe of them that dwell therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Becau≈øe it was a ≈øen≈øible, and a palpable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
As God Almighty told <hi>Caine, Gen. 4. 7.</hi> that
<hi>hee ≈øhould be cur≈øed from the earth.</hi> The Lord knew
that <hi>Caine</hi> cared not to be cur≈øed from heaven, and
to be bani≈øhed from the pre≈øence of God, and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for a Reprobate; but to bee cur≈øed from the
earth, to be cur≈øed in earthly things (hee being a
tiller of the earth) that would goe neare≈øt to his
heart of any judgement. Even ≈øuch is the di≈øpo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of every man of the earth (as <hi>David</hi> termes earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minded men) they doe not value nor care to be
cur≈øed from heaven, to be excommunicated out of
the favour of God, and out of the ble≈ø≈øed company
of all faithfull people (which cen≈øure of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16509:17"/>
if it be rightly carryed with a <hi>Clave non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante</hi>
(as the Schoolemen ≈øpeake) when there is no
errour committed in the u≈øe of the keyes, is one of
the greate≈øt puni≈øhments under heaven.) But carnall
men are not ≈øen≈øible of this, and therefore God will
puni≈øh them in that wherein they are ≈øen≈øible, in
their wives and children, in their corne and cattell,
&amp;c. in ≈øuch things as are neere≈øt and deare≈øt to them:
as when <hi>David</hi> ≈ølung his ≈øtone at <hi>Goliah,</hi> if hee had
≈øtrucke him upon any part of his harne≈ø≈øe, hee had
never felt the blow, but ≈øtriking him (as hee did) in
the forehead, which was naked and tender, that
≈øunke him pre≈øently; ≈øo it is with carnall men, for
≈øpirituall judgements, they are harne≈ø≈øed, their hearts
are hardned, their con≈øciences are ≈øeared, they have
(as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, a horny hoofe
(as it were) growne over their hearts, that makes
them in≈øen≈øible of any ≈øpirituall blow that can light
upon them. Therefore Almighty God, knowing in
what part they lie naked, in what kinde they are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
affected, namely, in their affection to earthly
things, ≈øtrikes them there, plagues them in that,
and that ≈øinkes them like <hi>Nabal,</hi> who≈øe heart dyed
within him like a ≈øtone. As we ≈øee in <hi>Exodus,</hi> how
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> hardned their heart, and
out ≈øtood all the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> till God plagued
them in their children, and that broke their hearts.
So beleeve it, they that care not for ≈øpirituall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments
(for the lo≈ø≈øe of Gods favour, the lo≈ø≈øe of
heaven, the lo≈ø≈øe and perill of their owne ≈øoules)
God will finde a time to puni≈øh them in that which
they doe and ≈øhall care for, in their corne, in their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16509:17"/>
≈øub≈øtance, in that which is neere≈øt and deare≈øt to
them: As he did the≈øe <hi>I≈øraelies</hi> here, becau≈øe they
were not ≈øen≈øible of the want of grace. God puni≈øht
them with that would make them ≈øen≈øible, with the
want of raine; that when they had plowed and
≈øowne their land, and be≈øtowed all their care and
co≈øt, all ≈øhould be in vaine, for want of moi≈øture to
refre≈øh the earth. The≈øe or the like rea≈øons (I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe)
might moove <hi>Eliah</hi> to pray and procure this
kinde of judgement.</p>
            <p>By the way, if any man de≈øire to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,
why God is not thus marveilous in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters
of the Go≈øpell, as hee was in <hi>Eliah,</hi> and tho≈øe
other Prophets of the Law; why wee that are his
Evangelicall Prophets cannot doe ≈øuch wonders in
our dayes, as they did in theirs? An≈øwer, though
that ≈øame <hi>donum miraculorum,</hi> the gift of Miracles
be cea≈øed in the Church, now that the Go≈øpell hath
taken roote: as Husbandmen when they tran≈øplant a
tree, at fir≈øt, they ≈øet props and ≈øtayes to ≈øhore it up,
but after it hath taken root, they take away the ≈øtaies
and let it grow by the ordinary influence of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;)
I ≈øay though the gift of working wonders be
cea≈øed, yet miracles &amp; wonders in another kind ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercea≈øe,
but are wrought daily by the Preachers of
the Go≈øpell. For you mu≈øt know that the miracles
under the Go≈øpell are of a differing nature from the
miracles under the Law: tho≈øe were <hi>ocularia mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi>
(as I may fitly call them) <hi>eye-miracles,</hi> that
were vi≈øible and outwardly apparent to be ≈øeene;
but the≈øe are <hi>Auricularia miracula, Eare-miracles,</hi>
≈øecret and invi≈øible, wrought in the heart by the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16509:18"/>
Word and Spirit of God, entring in at the eare, and
going downe into the ≈øoule. Though wee cannot
command, or forbid the raine to water the earth, as
<hi>Eliah</hi> did; if we can water and mollifie the earthen
hearts of men with the ≈øupernaturall raine of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Doctrine, and make a dry and barren ≈øoule
beare fruit to God; is not this as great a wonder as
the other? Though we cannot cau≈øe nor command
the thunder (as <hi>Samuel</hi> did) to terrifie the people for
their ≈øinnes; yet God hath his <hi>Boanerges,</hi> his ≈øons
of thunder ≈øtill, that by ratling from heaven the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
judgements of God again≈øt ≈øinne and ≈øinners,
are able to make the ≈øtoute≈øt and the proude≈øt heart
upon earth, even tremble and quake, and fall downe
before the pre≈øence of God; and is not this as great
a miracle as that of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to bring an unhumbled
≈øinner upon his knees, and make glad to cry God
mercy for his ≈øinnes? In a word, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ca≈øt out devils out of mens bodies, as the di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chri≈øt could doe; if wee can ca≈øt the devill
out of mens ≈øoules, by the powerfull Go≈øpell of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus
Chri≈øt; is it not as great a wonder? Beleeve it
brethren, the conver≈øion of a ≈øinner to God, and
bringing of a ≈øoule to heaven, is ab≈øolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
compari≈øon the greate≈øt miracle, the greate≈øt
wonder in the world. And the≈øe be the miracles
wherewith it plea≈øeth God to grace the Mini≈øters
of the Go≈øpell; therefore ye ob≈øerve, that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
for Mini≈øters, runs thus, <hi>Almighty God which only
worke≈øt great marvels, &amp;c.</hi> When a ≈øoule is ≈øicke to
the death, with a ≈øurfeit of ≈øinne, is recovered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
againe by that ≈øame healthfull ≈øpirit of grace,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16509:18"/>
which God together with his Word doth breathe
into the ≈øoule, it is ≈øo great a marvell, ≈øo rare a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the Angels of heaven rejoyce to ≈øee it.</p>
            <p>I have held you over-long in the former part of
<hi>Eliahs</hi> prayer, which brought the judgement: heare
now in a word or two, the Rever≈øing of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I have done. <hi>[And hee prayed againe, and
the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her
fruit.]</hi> It well becomes the Prophets of God to be
mercifull; Good <hi>Eliah</hi> had not the heart to hold
the people too long under a judgement, when hee
≈øaw he had done enough to humble them, he de≈øires
God to rever≈øe the judgement. As it is ob≈øerved of
the good Angels in the old and new Te≈øtament,
when they appeared to any, either man, or woman;
their method and manner was this, <hi>Primo terrent,
deinde laetificant,</hi> they fir≈øt terrified them, and put
them into feare, then pre≈øently comforted them,
and put them out of feare. Thus did <hi>Eliah</hi> with
this people; thus did <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that
good man had not the heart to hold wicked <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
alway under a judgement, but upon the lea≈øt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty
made ≈øuite to God to rever≈øe it. So dealt the
Prophet with <hi>Ieroboam, 1 Reg. 13. 6.</hi> when hee had
≈ømitten him with a judgement, and had him at the
advantage, that his hand was witnered, <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
was glad to ≈øubmit and ≈øay, <hi>Intreate now the face of
the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may
be restored me:</hi> The man of God had not the heart
to deny him, but immediately, be≈øought the Lord,
and the Kings hand was re≈øtored, and became as it
was before. When a judgement comes, then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16509:19"/>
are in ≈øea≈øon. <hi>Abraham</hi> is better than a King
in this ca≈øe, <hi>Gen. 20. 7. Re≈øtore the man his owne, for
he is a Prophet, and hee ≈øhall pray for thee;</hi> and ver.
17. <hi>Abraham prayed unto God, and God healed Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,
&amp;c. Goe to my ≈øervant Iob</hi> (≈øaith God to his
friends, <hi>Iob 42. 8.) and my ≈øervant Iob ≈øhall pray for
you, for him will I accept.</hi> So <hi>Act. 8. 24.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi>
had denounced a cur≈øe on <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he was glad
to crouch and cry unto him, <hi>Oh pray yee to the Lord
for me, that none of the≈øe things which ye have ≈øpoken
come upon mee.</hi> Thus yee ≈øee that judgements and
plagues will bring Prophets into reque≈øt: men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
deale with their Mini≈øters, as boyes doe by
Walnut-trees, and other fruit-trees, in faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
throw cudgels at us, in foule runne to us for
≈øhelter. In the dayes of peace and pro≈øperity wee
are pa≈øt over as ≈øuperfluous creatures, of whom
there is little u≈øe, and le≈ø≈øe neede: but when the
wrath of God fals on the naked ≈øoule, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience
is wounded within, and body pained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
then the Mini≈øter is thought on. I ≈øay no more,
if you de≈øire their prayers, and that God ≈øhould heare
them praying for you in your extremity, doe not
≈ølight them, doe not wrong them in pro≈øperity. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how <hi>Ahab</hi> and all <hi>I≈ørael</hi> were glad to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to <hi>Eliah</hi> to rever≈øe their judgement; and you
do not know how ≈øoone the ca≈øe may be your owne:
therefore as you love your ≈øoules, love tho≈øe that
have charge of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he prayed againe, &amp;c.</hi> When I looke into the
Story, <hi>1 Reg. 18.</hi> I can finde no direct prayer that
<hi>Eliah</hi> made for raine. But I finde there a twofold
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16509:19"/>
prayer that he made. 1. A vertuall. 2. A formall
prayer.</p>
            <p>1. A Vertuall prayer, not for raine, but for their
conver≈øion. <hi>Oh Lord,</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Eliah) bring backe, or
bring home the heart of this people unto thee; ver≈ø. 73.</hi>
and this includes all other prayers that can be made:
A prayer for conver≈øion is a prayer for every thing,
<hi>Ier. 31. 18.</hi> When <hi>Ephraim</hi> prayes for conver≈øion,
<hi>Turne thou me, and I ≈øhall be turned:</hi> (≈øaith God)
<hi>I will ≈øurely have mercy upon him &amp;c.</hi> Such is the
goodne≈ø≈øe of God, that he will with-hold no good
thing, (be it raine, be it plenty, be it any thing that
is good for them) from them that are converted,
and brought home by true repentance to him.
Therefore if thou ≈øtande≈øt in need of any temporall
mercy, pray fir≈øt for conver≈øion, and all other good
things ≈øhall be ≈øuper-added and throwne in unto
thee; or if thou praye≈øt for any child, or for any
friend to doe him good indeed, pray for his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion,
and thou praye≈øt for every thing, that one
prayer is <hi>in≈øtar omnium, in≈øteed of all the re≈øt.</hi> If he
be in an ill way, de≈øire God to bring him backe, and
for future things take no care.</p>
            <p>2. A formall prayer, when he ≈øaw that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were truely humbled, and that their hearts were
indeed brought home to God, in≈øomuch that they
cryed out, with an ingemmination, <hi>The Lord hee is
God, the Lord he is God,</hi> then he buckles his head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his knees (to ≈øhew the humble pro≈øtration
of his ≈øoule) and fals a praying to God for raine.
After humiliation any prayer comes in ≈øea≈øon, <hi>E≈øay
1. Wa≈øh ye, make ye cleane, put away the evill of your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16509:20"/>
doings, &amp;c. And now come</hi> (≈øaith God) <hi>and wee will
rea≈øon together,</hi> now let us parle, now let us confe≈ø≈øe,
now pray and I will heare you. <hi>Iud. 10. 17.</hi> When
the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> put away their ≈øtrange gods, and turned
them≈øelves to the true God by ≈øincere repentance
and reformation; the Text ≈øaith, <hi>His ≈øoule was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for the mi≈øery of I≈ørael:</hi> thus the onely way to
ca≈øe our owne ≈øoules of griefe, or to be rid of any
grievous judgement, is to <hi>grieve the ≈øoule of God,</hi> that
is, to humble our ≈øelves before him, to pray and
≈øeeke his face, and to turne from our wicked wayes,
and God will be even grieved with him≈øelfe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he puni≈øhed, plagued, and put us to griefe; and
he will returne (as he ≈øaith) and have mercy on us,
and will do us good after he hath done us hurt. Here
then (in a word) is the ready way to prevaile with
God, either for raine, or for faire weather, or for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
temporall ble≈ø≈øing what≈øoever, to doe as <hi>Eliah</hi>
did, buckle our very heads betweene our knees, I
meane, pro≈øtrate our ≈øelves before the face of God,
in the humble≈øt, in the lowlie≈øt, in the mo≈øt dejected
manner that we can device, and if any meanes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heaven will fetch downe mercy from heaven,
that will doe it. <hi>Eliah prayed againe, and the heavens
gave raine, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</hi> Now
to God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gho≈øt, be a≈øcribed and given, all honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be done and performed all ≈øervice and duty, from
this time forth for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
